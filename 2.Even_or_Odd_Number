/* Check Whether a Number is Even or Odd in C++
Given an integer input num, the objective is to write a code to Check Whether a Number is Even or Odd in C++. To do so we check if the number is divisible by 2 or not, it’s Even if it’s divisible otherwise Odd.

Example 
Input : num = 12
Output : Even */

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() 
{
  int num;  
  cin>>num;
  if(num%2 == 0)
    cout<<"the number is even";
  else
    cout<<"the number is odd";
}
